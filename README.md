## ChatGPT vs Recruitment Technical Tests

#### Overview

As a software engineer it’s normal for me to be asked to complete some kind of technical test during a recruitment process. There are many different methods, approaches and mistakes, but there’s value too. As the process has developed, better tools for analysing candidate skills have emerged. Let’s take as an example; testdome.com. It’s a platform on which a hiring manager can create in depth tests which really do measure a candidate’s knowledge in the areas they are interested in

Trouble is… when I’m looking for a job I’m generally talking to 2 or three different companies at once, so if they all give me big, difficult tech tests I get a bit over it. 

I mean, it’s not like I’m being paid for it is it?

 Now, in May 2023 we witness the emergence of ChatGPT. Much hype around its ability to answer questions in natural language. That’s nothing compared to how well it writes code. Better code than I do. And faster. So with a specific kind of test (eg testdome), I think I could use ChatGPT to complete the coding test quicker and better than I could do myself. So I think I’ll do that.

Is that cheating? Or is it just doing my job?
